# passwordStrength
This is a password strength checker that motivates you via trash talk. Because what is more motivating than a machine telling you, "you suck".

The website includes different strength levels, indicated by color. And it also includes a light/dark mode toggle.
It is preset to dark mode, but if you are that kinda (strange) person that likes light mode, just press the button and badabing badaboom lIgHt MoDe.

I hope you enjoy this website. Also please note, that passwords typed in the box are never stored/kept.
